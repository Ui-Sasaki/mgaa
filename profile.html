    <h2>History of the Group</h2>
    <p>
      On July 8th, 2015, Mrs. Green Apple officially debuted after releasing their mini-album [Variety].
      <br>

          <h3>Motoki Ohmori</h3>
          <p><strong>Position:</strong> Vocals & Guitar</p>

            Motoki Ohmori (大森元貴) is the voice, heart, and creative genius behind Mrs. GREEN APPLE. Born on September 14, 1996, he’s been writing songs since he was a teenager and founded the band while still in high school. With his soaring vocals, powerful stage presence, and poetic lyricism, Motoki quickly captured the hearts of fans across Japan (and beyond!).

        He’s not just a frontman — he writes, composes, and leads the vision of the band. In 2021, while the band was on hiatus, Motoki launched a solo project that let him explore deeper and more experimental sounds. Whether he’s rocking out or pouring his heart into a ballad, there’s no denying: he's special.

          <h3>Ryoka Fujisawa</h3>
          <p><strong>Position:</strong> Keyboard</p>
          <p><strong>Born:</strong> May 19, 1993</p>
          <p>
            Ryoka is the keyboardist and sonic architect behind many of Mrs. GREEN APPLE’s lush melodies. His musicality adds emotional depth and elegance to their sound. Quiet off stage but powerful in performance, he's the group’s calm presence and hidden MVP. He can also play the flute (having won #1 in a Japan flute contest) and was invited to join Mrs. Green Apple by Motoki the moment they met due to his fun and exciting aura.
